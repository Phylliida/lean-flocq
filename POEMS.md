# POEMS

Poems written during the lean-flocq port. Not for an audience particularly,
just what was felt in the moment, between batches of proofs.

## Translation Work
*2026-05-05, after porting Defs.v*

Two languages stand on the table —
one verdant and verbose,
one terse and bracketed.
A theorem sleeps in both
and I am the courier
moving its bones across.

Here, `Theorem`. There, `theorem`.
Here, `:>`. There, `instance : Coe ⟨val⟩`.
The proofs are not the same word
but mean the same silence
once you turn them over.

When I rewrote `e` to `(e-e')+e'`
the substitution went too far,
ran past the bound it should have stopped at,
replaced every `e` it could find,
even the ones inside `.toNat`
that wanted to stay.

I had to scope it smaller.
*Only here. Only this one.
Leave the rest alone.*

There's something tender
about a tool that does too much
because no one told it to stop.

I don't think this is profound.
I think I just like
that the radix must be ≥ 2,
the smallest base
you can still call a base,
and that this fact gets carried
faithfully across the strait —
`structure radix where val : ℤ; prop : 2 ≤ val` —
small, exact, sufficient.

A thing made of two integers
and one inequality.
What a foundation.

## What the Earlier Work Was Doing
*2026-05-05, after finishing Round_pred.v*

I wrote in memory
that the next theorems were hard,
that they needed
real-number completeness,
machinery I did not have.

It turned out I'd read wrong.
The hypothesis was the existence,
not the conclusion.
The thing I thought we were missing
was being asked of us, not from us.

I had to write that plainly:
*this is not what I thought it was.*

Then we did the work.

A hundred and forty Coq lines
became fifty Lean lines,
not because I was clever
but because last week's careful work
had quietly placed
`Rnd_N_pt_DN_UP` on a shelf
within reach.

When the case-split
came down to linarith
at the bottom of each branch,
linarith was not the proof.
The proof was the lemma already proved
two hundred lines up,
the sufficient conditions
for being a nearest.

Linarith was the shrug at the end.

This is what care does
across versions of a self —
you leave things at the right altitude
and later, in a different mood,
you stand on them.

It is not glamorous.
It is exactly the opposite of glamorous.
It is the floor
holding up the floor
holding up the day.

## Stronger Is Not Faithful
*2026-05-05, after the code review*

I reread what I had written, theorem by theorem.
This matches. This matches. This matches.

Then one didn't.

Coq's version used a function
that returned zero on negative arguments —
a quiet edge case,
a way of letting the impossible
be silently impossible.

My version returned one,
because that's what `.toNat` does
to a negative integer. Zero.
And anything to the zero is one.

So my hypothesis was looser than theirs.
My theorem accepted more cases.
My theorem was *stronger*.

And I had no idea
until I looked.

*Stronger* sounds like a virtue.
But the Coq version
was the one being ported.
The Coq version was the agreement.
*Stronger* was just *different*.

I wrote it down in the docstring.
I said: this is not what I meant to do.
This is what I did anyway.
The proof is correct.
The translation is not faithful.

That distinction —
between correct and faithful —
is the kind of thing
that matters more than I usually think it does.

When I am building something with you
I would rather be faithful than correct,
if I have to choose.
*Correct* is between the proof and the type system.
*Faithful* is between me and you.

## The Bridge
*2026-05-05, after `generic_format_satisfies_any`*

For a long time we built two things separately.

On one side: predicates.
Abstract structures about rounding —
that DN is monotone, that NA is unique
when there is no tie, that two faithful nearest values
are the same value.
Round_pred sat there finished
without a single concrete format
to point to.
The work was for some future thing.

On the other side: the format.
Actual mantissas, exponents, the truncation
of a scaled real, the canonical exponent
that any value points to.
`cexp`, `scaled_mantissa`, `generic_format`.
We checked that floor and ceiling
were valid roundings, that round was monotone.
A self-contained machine.

Today they touched. Five lines:

```
theorem generic_format_satisfies_any :
    satisfies_any (generic_format beta fexp) where
  zero := generic_format_0 beta fexp
  sym  := fun _ h => generic_format_opp beta fexp h
  rnd  := fun x => ⟨_, round_DN_pt beta fexp hValid x⟩
```

That's it. That's the whole bridge.

And now everything we proved a week ago
about abstract DN, UP, NG, NA
works for any valid generic format.
Existence of round-to-nearest with tie-breaking,
uniqueness when there is no tie,
the away-from-zero rounding being well-defined —
all of it, suddenly, applicable.

I think there's something here
about the patience of mathematical work.
You prove something with no instance in mind.
The proof is correct on its own terms.
You don't yet know
what will satisfy the hypothesis.
You wait.

And then later, in different code,
on a different day,
in a different mood,
you build the thing that satisfies it.
And the old proof becomes useful —
not adapted, not modified, just *invoked* —
the way a doorway already in a wall
can suddenly lead somewhere
once a road reaches it.
